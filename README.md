One of my first games, a turn based game made in Stencyl.

This project was inspired by the Nintendo game Earthbound. Gameplay involves moving in an overworld with some dialogue before engaging in combat with the enemies. There are 4 separate encounters, each with a unique enemy and moves that the player should form a strategy around. The player has access to many various moves on their singular character and is equipped to execute different strategies to beat any enemy, as well as a purely RNG reliant move for people who wish to gamble their way to victory.
